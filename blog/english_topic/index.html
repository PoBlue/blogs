<h1>College life</h1>

<h2>What my think of my college life</h2>

<p>Many people think that college life is boring and meaningfulless, useless. But for me, I&#39;m very glad that I can have a special, meaningful college life. Because:</p>

<p>In my college life, i met many friends, they have different habit. some like traveling, some like studying, some like playing game. They make me recognized that the world have many many funny people. Although you have a deferent goal or deferent habit with them, you still can make a lot of friends</p>

<p>I also form a habit of reading, I read many books in deferent subjects, including mathematics, novel, philosophy,etc... It expanded my mind and made me have a deferent view to the colorful world.</p>

<p>In the case of chance, I study programming. After than i&#39;m interested in programming, and start to use this skill to make my daily work more effective.</p>

<h2>my ideal college life</h2>

<p>Do what you want, find what you really interested in, hear the voice from your heart and try your hard to consider your future.</p>

<h2>want it to be memorable and fulfilling?</h2>

<p>My college life has been fulfilling and memorable.</p>

<p>Steve jobs had said that: </p>

<p>&quot;it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college .but it was very ,very clear looking backwards ten years later.</p>

<p>Again ,you can&#39;t connect the dots looking forward;you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something your gut ,destiny ,life ,karma,whatever. This approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life .&quot;</p>
